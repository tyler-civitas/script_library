#Analysis on New Quote Form

Quote Form | Quotes Returned | Viewers | Returned Percentage
---:|:---:|:---:|:---
Baseline|32|595|5.4%
Variation 1|30|599|5.0%
Variation 2|18|622|2.9%
Variation 3|51|606|8.4%
Variation 4|38|578|6.6%
**Total**|**169**|**3000**|**5.6%**

**Basic Statistics on Data Set**  
Average Viewers: 600  
Average Responses: 33.8  
Average Quote Returned Percentage: 5.7%  
Standard Deviation of Returned Percentages in 5 samples: 2.0% (not used below)   
TOTAL response rate: 5.6%

## First step: Look at the data

#### Scatter plot - Responses(y) vs Viewers(x)

The scatterplot of the data **is just a visual check**.

#### Bar Chart - Response rate(Y) for each variation

The bar chart makes it appear, at first glance, that **Variation 3** is the best form to use if we want an increased quote response rate to invitations.

#### Chi-Squared Independence Test

To determine if our variations are having an effect on the returned quotes, we use the Chi-squared test for independence to determine whether they are associated.

We can build a contingency table by separating the cases for each variation where a quote was returned or not returned.

For each value in the contingency table, an expected value is computed, and a Chi-squared statistic for the data can be computed.

Chi-squared statistic: **19.1**  
Degrees of Freedom: **4**  
Null-Hypothesis: The Variations are _not_ associated to the quotes returned.  
Alternate-Hypothesis: The Variations _are_ associated to the quotes returned.  
Critical-value, P-value(Chi-squared: 19.1, dF 4, significance 5%): **9.5**  

Because the test statistic is greater than the critical value:

> 19.1 > 9.5

The Alternate-Hypothesis is True. The variations ARE associated to the number of quotes returned. This gives us confidence that the experimental results are meaningful.

## Findings

The data set is lacking some key information about the _service_, _category_, and _location_, but we can try to make some simple inferences.

#### Response Rate
The first step is to look at the response rate - the number of quotes returned for each of the 5 forms.


If we assume that the average probability of a response is total_responses/total_viewers (5.6%), the standard deviation of that probability for 3000 responses will give us:

> Stddev = sqrt(n(p)(1-p)) = 12.5 responses in a 3000 viewer sample.

We can be 95% confident that our response rate should be between 3.8% and 7.4%. This tells use that our variations _ARE INDEED_ having an effect on the response rate, since many of them are outside the confidence range.

By simply looking at the response rates, **Variation 3** has the best response rate, more than twice that of variation 2.



> My assumptions are:
> * Response rates for any given service follow a typically normal distribution about the average response rate that we get here at acme.
> * The 3000 invites were randomly divided among service providers
> * The requests, and their parameters (category, location, service needed) are representative of our typical requests.

### Concerns

1. Are there any similarities between the 5 quote forms?
2. Is the category/location proportion among the services the same for each of the 5 samples?
  * If not, then different response rates may be caused by category/locality.
3. How were the quote forms divided among the 3000 viewers? Randomly or in sequence (viewer 1 gets quote 1, viewer 2 gets form 2...)?
  * If the quotes were divided iteratively, then there could be bias in the results

---
## Summary

The variations on the form are having an effect on the response rate. Variation 3 is the best one, and should be used from now on.
